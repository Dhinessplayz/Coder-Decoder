NOTE :

Make sure that you understand the code clearly before making any changes, as this might cause certain errors which will be hard to detect and fix.
The #Coder-Decoder project works perfectly, it does not use any extra packages, you only need the base python file to run #Coder-Decoder.
If there are problems with #Coder-Decoder, it is a problem majorly on your side, make sure you have Python 3.9 and above


Requirements :

 - Python 3.9 and above
 - An IDE (Obviously)
